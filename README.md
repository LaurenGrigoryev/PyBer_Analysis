# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type: rural, suburban, and urban. I then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, created a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, this data analysis showed how the data differs by city type and indicated how those differences could be used by decision makers at PyBer.

## Results
When looking over a summary of the data, it is clear that the most total fares come from urban areas[Summary Data](https://github.com/LaurenSonis/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/2021-01-10%20(1).png). Total Fares were roughly $40,000 for urban cities, $19,000 for suburban, and $4,000 for rural areas. The average fare per trip and the average fare per driver was much higher in rural areas. Suburban areas trended down the middle.

This is in part due to a larger driver population. Rural areas had only 78 drivers, suburban had 490, and urban had 2,405. 

Total rides differed based on city type as well. Urban areas had the highest number of rides at 1,625, whereas suburban areas had 625, and rural areas had only 125. 

Furthermore, when looking over a line-chart that summarizes weekly fare trends, it is easy to see that urban drivers bring in the highest total fares every week[Line Chart](https://github.com/LaurenSonis/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/2021-01-10%20(2).png).

## Summary
Based on these results, to address disparities among city types, I would recommend:
1) The company should alter advertising based on city type. In urban areas, the average fare per driver and per trip would likely be lower due to shorter distances traveled. The company should therefore focus advertising in a way to celebrate short, fast trips in urban areas to generate more short rides.
2) The company should recruit more drivers in rural and suburban areas to increase income.
3) The company should request that city governments in urban areas allow them to use emergency lanes during rush hour to reduce gas emissions, which would keep rider turnover high in urban areas.
