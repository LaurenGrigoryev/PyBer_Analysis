# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type: rural, suburban, and urban. I then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, created a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, this data analysis showed how the data differs by city type and indicated how those differences could be used by decision makers at PyBer.

## Results
When looking over a summary of the data, it is clear that the most total fares come from urban areas. This is in part due to a larger driver population. The average fare per trip and the average fare per driver was much higher in rural areas. Suburban areas trended down the middle.
Furthermore, when looking over a line-chart that summarizes weekly fare trends, it is easy to see that urban drivers bring in the highest total fares every week.

## Summary
Based on these results, to address any disparities among city types, I would recommend:
1)
2)
