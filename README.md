# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type: rural, suburban, and urban. I then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, created a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, this data analysis showed how the data differs by city type and indicated how those differences could be used by decision makers at PyBer.
